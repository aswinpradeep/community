# Sunbird Anuvaad Overview

`Project Anuvaad`<img src=".gitbook/assets/image (6).png" alt="" data-size="line"> is an open-sourced project funded by EkStep foundation.&#x20;

Anuvaad is an AI based open source Document Translation Platform to _digitize and translate_ documents in Indic languages at scale. Anuvaad provides easy-to-edit capabilities on top the plug & play NMT models. Separate instances of Anuvaad are deployed to [Diksha](https://diksha.anuvaad.org/) (NCERT), [Supreme Court of India ](https://jud.anuvaad.org/)(SUVAS) and Supreme Court of Bangladesh (Amar Vasha).

`Project Anuvaad` is REST APIs driven and hence any third party system can use various features like sentence translation, layout detection etc
With this approach, developers can leverage the power of your translation service to provide multilingual support or enable communication across language barriers in their own systems. They can send a request to your API with the source text and the desired target language, and your API will handle the translation process and provide the translated result as a response.

This kind of flexibility and interoperability offered by REST APIs makes it easier for different systems to work together and create powerful, integrated solutions.
