# Sunbird Anuvaad Overview

`Project Anuvaad` is an open-sourced project funded by EkStep foundation. Anuvaad is a productivity tool that leverages AI and machine learning technologies to accomplish end to end document translation.&#x20;

`Project Anuvaad` is REST APIs driven hence any third party system can use various functionality. One such popular functionality is sentence translation.
With this approach, developers can leverage the power of your translation service to provide multilingual support or enable communication across language barriers in their own systems. They can send a request to your API with the source text and the desired target language, and your API will handle the translation process and provide the translated result as a response.

This kind of flexibility and interoperability offered by REST APIs makes it easier for different systems to work together and create powerful, integrated solutions.
