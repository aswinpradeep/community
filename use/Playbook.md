## Account Creation

Users shall onboard themselves on Anuvaad via the link below:\
\
Registration: [https://users.anuvaad.org/user/signup#](https://users.anuvaad.org/user/signup)

Once a user reaches the Sign Up page, they have to fill in the required details as shown below:

Upon successful submission, an E-Mail will be sent to the registered ID with a verification link

{% hint style="info" %}
Please check the spam folder as well for authentication E-Mail
{% endhint %}

Clicking the verification link will redirect the user to the login page as shown below

For security purposes, Anuvaad follows an OTP-based login mechanism. You will be asked for the E-Mail to which a one-time password will be sent.

Upon confirming the ID, you will be asked to opt for one of the authentication methods.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
Note that the selected authentication method could be changed later on as well.
{% endhint %}

Everything discussed above is a one-time process and must be applicable only on initial login to the application. Going forward, you will be redirected to the OTP verification page upon successful login.&#x20;

Upon providing the correct OTP, the user will reach the below landing page of Anuvaad and we are good to go!

## Translate Sentence

The translate sentence feature enables the user to input a text and instantaneously get its translation in another language. To use it, simply click on the **Translate Sentence** option on the landing page of Anuvaad.&#x20;

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot from 2023-09-26 01-12-38.png" alt="" width="563"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

The user will have to select the source language to which he provides the input and the target language to which the text must be translated.&#x20;

If an Indic language is selected as the source, by default _Transliteration_ feature will be enabled, assisting the user to type in that particular language from the normal keyboard with ease.&#x20;

Upon clicking submit, the translated sentence will be displayed along with the model used to perform the translation. Using this feature, a stakeholder can quickly check the accuracy of the translation performed by Anuvaad.

## Translate Document

The translate document feature enables the user to upload a document and get its translated version. The key highlight of the feature is that Anuvaad tries to maintain the original structure of the document in the best possible manner.

To perform a document translation, click on the **Translate Document** option on the landing page of Anuvaad. You will be greeted with a screen as below

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot from 2023-09-26 01-23-22.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Here, the user will have the provision to upload a document (pdf,docx,pptx formats are supported as of now)  and select a source and target language to perform translation. On successful upload of a supported file, the process begins and status will be shown

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot from 2023-09-26 01-26-04.png" alt="" width="563"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

There are various stages happening behind the scenes of document translation and the status will be displayed on screen. The total time taken to complete the process depends on the number of pages and the structure of the input document. The translation is an `async` process and once initiated it will be performed in the background. Users can keep on adding more and more tasks to Anuvaad meanwhile.&#x20;

After a certain time, by going to the [Translation Dashboard](https://users.anuvaad.org/view-document), the user can access the translated document.

Users can make necessary changes to the document using Anuvaad's easy editor which is developed by seeing document translators forefront, and later on download the translated document back to their system in the desired format.&#x20;
